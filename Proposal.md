## Project Team 23

## App Description

This app aims to help users organize their tasks. Users will be able to see what tasks are coming up chronologically and the time remaining for each task, along with customizable notes for each task. Users will also have the option to set a timer when they want to complete the task to focus and prevent the user from using the phone by breaking the timer when the user leaves the page.

## Minimal Goals

The app will contain a main page that shows upcoming tasks, along with an interface to create, edit, delete, or complete tasks. For each task, users will be able to customize the following information:

 * The due date of the task.
 * The title of the task.
 * The description of the task.

After the task is created, when the user swipes the selected task to the left, there will be a focus option to set up a timer. After entering the desired time, the user will be led to the timer page. 

When the user completes the task, the user will be able to write reflection for the task and be able to take pictures to record.

## Stretch Goals

We have identified the following stretch goals:

 * Game System: Develop a system where users earn experience points (EXP) upon completing tasks. Additionally, create a user profile displaying their current level and completed tasks.
 * History: The user will be able to view the task they completed in the past.
 * Task organization: Enhance organization by implementing categories, tags, or priority levels for tasks.

## Project Timeline

### Milestone 1

 * Design the user interface for the home page and task pages.
 * Implement the ability to create a new task.
 * Develop a scrollable list of the created tasks.
 * Enable users to mark tasks as completed.

### Milestone 2
 * Provide functionality for users to customize for the tasks.
 * Allow long-pressing on existing tasks to open a corresponding window, enabling users to edit or delete the task.
 * Swiping existing tasks to the left will lead the user to the timer page. 
 * Create an interface for the user to write reflection and take pictures for completed tasks.

### Milestone 3

Fully implement the minimal features:
 * Include an "add" button floating on the home page, opening a new window for setting the title, due date, and description.
 * Allow the user to set up a timer on the timer page.
 * Make the timer break once the user leaves the existing application.
 * Allow the user to see the total time they focus on specific tasks when long-pressing on existing tasks.
 * Implement the functionality of using a camera to take photos and attach to the reflection. 


If time permits, implement the stretch goals:
 * Integrate notifications to remind users of upcoming tasks.
 * Develop game features, allow users to receive experience scores after task completion.
 * Develop a history page that shows the past task users have completed.
 * Enable task organization by implementing categories, tags, or priority levels.
